How it works
---
* below file structure will be installed
```
.
├── README.md
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Yakefile
├── deploy
│   ├── prod
│   │   └── docker-compose.yml
│   └── rancher

```
* Your project directory name will be filled as local domain name and docker image namespace (see `docker-compose.yml`)
* new rules will be added to Your `.gitignore` file: 
  * `/composer.phar` internal project composer
  * `/docker/*/*.env` container ENV
